*  Loading data

This case study analyzes the dataset of procrastination data. The dataset is not in a tidy format and munging is needed.

Raw data is read into procrastination_data data frame.

There are 4262 entries in the original procrastination dataset which contain the following information:

• Age: The participant’s age in years.
• Gender: The gender the participant identifies as (Male or Female)
• Kids: Binary, whether they have kids or not.
• Edu: Education level
• Work Status: What kind of job are they working?
• Annual Income: All converted to dollars.
• Current Occupation: A write-in for occupation.
• How long have you held this position?: Years: Number of years in this job.
• How long have you held this position?: Months: Number of months in this job.
• Community: Size of community
• Country of Residence: The country where the person holds citizenship.
• Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced, Separated, etc.
• Number of sons/Number of daughters: integer number of children.
• All variables starting DP(5 columns/questions) – the Decisional Procrastination Scale (Mann, 1982)
• All variables starting AIP(15 columns/quesions) – Adult Inventory of Procrastination (McCown & Johnson, 1989)
• All variables starting GP(20 columns/questions) – the General Procrastination scale (Lay, 1986)
• All variables starting SWLS(5 columns/questions) – the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985)
• Do you consider yourself a procrastinator?: a binary response
• Do others consider you a procrastinator?: a binary response

HDI is a data frame we obtained from wiki by web scraping. HDI data frame contains the following information:

• country - countries are recognized as soverign nations
• HDI score - numbers
• HDI category - categorized as low, medium, high, very high

The final data set(cleaned-up procrastination data) being used for the analysis is saved as csv file -> Output/cleaned_data.csv

*  Analyzing/Manipulating data

1. Procrastination data - after cleaning, saved in to data frame Procrastination_data 

• Renaming the values of the columns to limit the size of all variable names to 12 characters or less and creating sequential names based on the source questionnaire. 

• Eliminating values that don't make sense as well as errors that occurred when the data was exported.

• In the occupation column, replacing zeros with NAs

• In the number of sons data, relabelling the genders back to integers with Male=1 and Female =2.

• In the income column, replacing NAs with zeros

• In the kids column, update the data to only Yes and No

• In the age column, truncating all values of age after the decimal

• In the country of residence column, replacing zeros with NAs

• In the column of question: Do you consider yourself a procrastinator and Do others consider you a procrastinator, replacing blanks and numbers with NAs

• In the column of gender, replacing blanks with NAs

• Creating columns for the mean of DP, AIP, GP and SWLS.

• The job titles also need to be organized. 

	* Any job title with 'please specify' will be assigned to a NA to be treated as missing.
	
	* All students are titled as student.
	
	* Professional job titles are being assigned to a more general term, i.e. yoga teacher and ESL teacher were simplified to teacher.
	
	* Everyone with a job status of Unemployed with a blank occupation is assigned the value Unemployed for their occupation 
	
	* All Job titles under 5 characters were made to an empty string.
	
	* All jobs with a slash (/) had all text after the slash removed.
	
	* All jobs with parentheses had the parentheses removed.
	
	* All jobs with leading and trailing white space were trimmed.

2. HDI table - web scrapping from wikipedia and saved into data frame HDI

• pulling data (HDI for nations recognized by the United Nation only) from the Human Development Index page on Wikipedia

• combine this data from different tables and assign it a category value based on the HDI score

3. Merging cleaned-up procrastination data to the HDI data pulled from Wikipedia - saved into data frame merged_data

4. merged_data has been subsetted due to client's request - saved into data frame cleaned_data

• selecting a subset of only ages that we can confirm are over the age of 18

• The analysis is based on this cleaned_data

9.	Nations and regions show up both in GP and AIP
	Taiwan,Puerto Rico,Qatar,Panama,Sri Lanka,Turkey,Ecuador,France,Uruguay

10. 	Relationship between age and income:
	At younger ages it appears men and women have about the same mean income, but as they get older on average men will make more money than women.

11. 	Relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI Score:
	In countries that have lower HDI, females appear to have higher life satisfaction level than males.As the HDI increases, the life satisfaction diffenrecence between females and males is getting smaller.

12. 	Relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI Category:
	In countries that have low human development category, the life satisfaction mean scores are the lowest.
	In countries that have medium human development category, the life satisfaction mean scores are the higher than those from high human development category.

*  Writing final data to CSV

The OutPut file contains the following csv files: 
1. 	HDI.csv          - write HDI table from wiki(web scraping) into csv

3. 	GP15.csv         - top 15 nation with mean GP score as well as their HDI scores
4. 	AIP15.csv        - top 15 nation with mean AIP score as well as their HDI scores
