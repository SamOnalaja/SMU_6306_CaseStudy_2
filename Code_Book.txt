Loading data

This case study analyzes the dataset of procrastination data. The dataset is not in a tidy format and munging is needed.
Raw data is read into procrastination_data data frame.
There are 4262 entries in the original procrastination dataset which contain the following information:
• Age: The participant’s age in years.
• Gender: The gender the participant identifies as (Male or Female)
• Kids: Binary, whether they have kids or not.
• Edu: Education level
• Work Status: What kind of job are they working?
• Annual Income: All converted to dollars.
• Current Occupation: A write-in for occupation.
• How long have you held this position?: Years: Number of years in this job.
• How long have you held this position?: Months: Number of months in this job.
• Community: Size of community
• Country of Residence: The country where the person holds citizenship.
• Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced, Separated, etc.
• Number of sons/Number of daughters: integer number of children.
• All variables starting DP(5 columns/questions) – the Decisional Procrastination Scale (Mann, 1982)
• All variables starting AIP(15 columns/quesions) – Adult Inventory of Procrastination (McCown & Johnson, 1989)
• All variables starting GP(20 columns/questions) – the General Procrastination scale (Lay, 1986)
• All variables starting SWLS(5 columns/questions) – the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985)
• Do you consider yourself a procrastinator?: a binary response
• Do others consider you a procrastinator?: a binary response

HDI is a data frame we obtained from wiki by web scraping. HDI data frame contains the following information:
• country - countries are recognized as soverign nations
• HDI score - numbers
• HDI category - categorized as low, medium, high, very high

The procrastination_data is merged with HDI data frame on country, then being subsetted to study subjects over the age of 18.
The final data set being used for the analysis is saved as csv file -> Output/cleaned_data.csv

9.	Nations and regions show up both in GP and AIP
	Taiwan,Puerto Rico,Qatar,Panama,Sri Lanka,Turkey,Ecuador,France,Uruguay

10. 	Relationship between age and income:
	At younger ages it appears men and women have about the same mean income, but as they get older on average men will make more money than women.

11. 	Relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI Score:
	In countries that have lower HDI, females appear to have higher life satisfaction level than males.As the HDI increases, the life satisfaction diffenrecence between females and males is getting smaller.

12. 	Relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI Category:
	In countries that have low human development category, the life satisfaction mean scores are the lowest.
	In countries that have medium human development category, the life satisfaction mean scores are the higher than those from high human development category.

Writing final data to CSV

The OutPut file contains the following csv files: 
1. 	HDI.csv          - write HDI table from wiki(web scraping) into csv
